      <p width="50%">
        My goal for this internship is to better understand the theories, ideas,
        and practices of coding. As I engage in a hands-on, work-based, learning
        experiences, I hope to be a refined frontend wed developer after three
        months. I am very optimist that I will finish well. Lets do this!!!!.
